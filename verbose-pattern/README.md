# Verbose Pattern in Python

## Introduction

The term *Verbose Pattern* is used here as a convenient, informal name to describe this structure. It does not correspond to any officially recognized design pattern.

This approach is related to the following design patterns and principles:

* **Factory Pattern**: Delegating object creation to dedicated functions.
* **Interface Segregation Principle**: Separating interfaces by roles.
* **Facade Pattern**: Hiding complex internal structures behind simple external interfaces.
* **Strategy Pattern**: Separating functionality based on roles.

The pattern defines factory functions in two layers, with the goal of enabling incremental validation and testing of each processing unit. It is intended for adoption in long-lived, low-volume, fundamental components.

## Characteristics

* Clearly separates the external-facing interface from the internal-facing interface used during development and testing.
* Makes it possible to represent a state where variables are defined but have not yet been “meaningfully initialized,” enabling stepwise testing of initialization.
* Provides role-based interfaces that can be independently verified, making it easier to set the granularity of tests.
* The introduction of a **\_Kernel** allows external factory functions to be accessed in the same way (or a similar way) by both the core and tests, ensuring consistent usage conditions.
* The **\_DelegatingBridge** enables structured delegation from one factory function to another.
* Code complexity scales with the number of interfaces actually required, since only the necessary ones are implemented.

## Implementation Approach

The factory function is split into two layers.
The first layer, `_create_interface_role`, returns multiple role-structured interfaces (e.g., `_Constant` and `_State` for constants and state getters).
Tests can then be performed against these individual interfaces.

### Implementation Structure (Pseudo-code)

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Protocol

# TOC = 'Table of content'

class Interface(ABC):
    # Public-facing interface. Defined as an ABC for type checking.
    __slots__ = ()

class _ConstantTOC(Protocol):
    # Defines constants used inside the factory function.
    ...

class _StateTOC(Protocol):
    # Defines an interface for accessing mutable internal state.
    ...

class _KernelTOC(Protocol):
    # Provides access to external factory functions.
    # Abstracts external factory calls so that both core and tests
    # can access them under identical conditions.
    ...

class _CoreTOC(Protocol):
    # Defines internal-only helper functions.
    ...

class _DelegatingBridgeTOC(Protocol):
    # Defines entities related to this factory’s functionality/state
    # and delegates them as needed.
    # Multiple definitions can exist depending on delegation categories.
    ...

class _RoleTOC(Protocol):
    # Index into the internal structure of the interfaces.
    constant: _ConstantTOC
    state: _StateTOC
    kernel: _KernelTOC
    core: _CoreTOC
    bridge: _DelegatingBridgeTOC
    interface: Interface

def _create_interface_role() -> _RoleTOC:
    # Internal factory function intended for developers during
    # testing, extension, and development.

    class _Constant(_ConstantTOC):
        __slots__ = ()
    constant = _Constant()

    class _State(_StateTOC):
        __slots__ = ()
    state = _State()

    class _Kernel(_KernelTOC):
        __slots__ = ()
    kernel = _Kernel()

    class _Core(_CoreTOC):
        __slots__ = ()
    core = _Core()

    class _DelegatingBridge(_DelegatingBridgeTOC):
        __slots__ = ()
    bridge = _DelegatingBridge()

    class _Interface(Interface):
        __slots__ = ()
    interface = _Interface()

    class _Role(_RoleTOC):
        __slots__ = ()
        constant: _ConstantTOC
        state: _StateTOC
        kernel: _KernelTOC
        core: _CoreTOC
        bridge: _DelegatingBridgeTOC
        interface: Interface

    return _Role(
        constant=constant,
        state=state,
        kernel=kernel,
        core=core,
        bridge=bridge,
        interface=interface
    )

def create_interface() -> Interface:
    # Public-facing factory function for creating the interface.
    return _create_interface_role().interface
```

### Notes

* In the pseudo-code, `__slots__` are defined for all interfaces, but this is optional. (It prevents accidental injection of unexpected state into interfaces, though this is more of a stylistic choice than a requirement.)
* Similarly, all interfaces could be classes without instantiation. However, using raw classes requires additional complexity such as metaclasses for `__slots__` or `@classmethod` usage. For simplicity, the example instantiates everything. If applied to lightweight, high-volume entities (not the intended use case here), defining everything as classes without instantiation might be worth considering.
* The overall structure is deliberately verbose to preserve both incremental testability and static type-checking.
* Internal interfaces use `Protocol` instead of ABC to avoid boilerplate decoration, but using ABC throughout is also possible. This choice depends on developer preference and project requirements.
